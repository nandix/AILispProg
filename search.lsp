                    ***** SEARCH.LSP *****

General-purpose exhaustive search routine includes both breadth-first
search and depth-first search. Uses graph search with OPEN and CLOSED
lists rather than tree search, to avoid cycles. Does not use heuristics
to limit or guide search.

To solve a specific problem, the functions "generate-successors" and
"goal-state" must be defined. "Generate-successors" takes a state as its
argument and returns a list of child states. "Goal-state?" returns T if
its argument is a goal state, NIL otherwise.

In order to retrace a solution path, nodes are stored as (state parent)
pairs, where "state" is the current state and "parent" is the parent
state. Given a goal node, a solution path is generated by simply tracing
backwards through the parent states.

;		bound each time. This will continue until a solution is found.
;
; Parameters:	start - start state representation
;
; Return:	solution path from start state to goal state

; Function: 	bounded_dfs
;
; Author:	John M. Weiss, Ph.D., Modified by Dylan Geyer
;
; Description:	This is a modification of the depth first search code provided
;		by Dr. Weiss. This function takes a depth bound as an optional
;		argument and without it it will run as 'unbounded' with an
;		essentially infinite depth bound. The modifications that make
;		this function depth bounded is the encapsulation of the generate
;		succesors code in an if statement that checks the current depth
;		agains the depth bound. If we have reach the depth bound then
;		no more successors are generated.
;
; Parameters:	start - start state representation
;		depthbound - Maximum depth to search, default to 9999
;
; Return:	solution path from start state to goal state
